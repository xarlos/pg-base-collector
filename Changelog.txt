# Changelog
# ---------
#
# v0.8
# Some big changes have been made here now regarding the way deletes are handled. 
# I now look for the last tar file in the given X files to keep, and then "find" files that 
# are older than this. This can open up problems where if anything other than the postgres
# tar and wals files are present, they could be deleted. Granted they shouldn't be there, 
# but i may put a check in to ensure that if they are - i will highlight and exit. 
#
# v0.7
# Changed the way it finds the old archive logs. This way seems much cleaner
# though i really wanted to make sure that any other logs in here are not 
# likely to be deleted by mistake (though ideally this folder should be bare 
# postgres backup data). Or else it could be cleaner still.
#
# v0.6 
# More of a detailed report is now available afterwards. 
# It also allows the alility for email here too.
#
# v0.5
