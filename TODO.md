pg-base-collector - TO DO
=========================

Remove the original backup
--------------------------
when the tar is taken for the base, it is then COPIED rather than moved to the final destination. I should change this, 
but for testing purposes i had left as a copy. 

Optional Base only
------------------
$0 baseonly
Option to only take the base backups, and NOT to remove any of the archived WALs. 


Suggestions welcome
-------------------
If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
